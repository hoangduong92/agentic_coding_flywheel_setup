# What is PT?

Ever wondered why your build is slow, or what's eating all your CPU?

**PT (Process Triage)** helps you find, analyze, and manage system processes intelligently. Unlike basic tools like `top` or `htop`, PT provides context-aware information and smart suggestions.

---

# Checking Installation

Verify PT is installed:

```bash
pt --help
```

---

# Quick Overview

Get a snapshot of what's running:

```bash
pt
```

This shows a summary of active processes organized by resource usage.

---

# Finding Resource Hogs

What's consuming the most CPU and memory?

```bash
pt --top
```

This ranks processes by resource consumption, making it easy to spot problems.

---

# Searching for Processes

Looking for something specific? Search by name:

```bash
pt search node
```

This finds all processes matching "node" and shows their resource usage.

---

# Finding Port Users

Need to know what's using port 3000?

```bash
pt --port 3000
```

This is invaluable when debugging "port already in use" errors.

---

# Why PT Matters for Agents

When AI agents run builds, tests, or compilations, they can spawn many processes. PT helps diagnose:

- Why a build is slow
- What's consuming memory
- Which processes are stuck
- Port conflicts

---

# Common Scenarios

```bash
# Build running slowly? Check what's competing for CPU
pt --top

# Can't start dev server? Find what's using the port
pt --port 3000

# Memory issues? Find the culprits
pt search --sort-by memory
```

---

# Summary

You've learned:
1. **pt** — Quick process overview
2. **pt --top** — Find resource hogs
3. **pt search** — Find specific processes
4. **pt --port** — Identify port users

PT is a diagnostic tool that helps you understand what's happening on your system.
