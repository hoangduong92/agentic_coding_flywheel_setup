# What is JFP?

In Lesson 11, you learned how `ms` manages skills locally. But where do good skills come from?

**JFP (JeffreysPrompts.com CLI)** gives you access to a curated library of battle-tested prompts for Claude, GPT, and other AI coding agents. The CLI and website share the same prompt library.

Prompts are organized into bundles and workflows. You can browse, copy to clipboard, or install directly as Claude Code skills.

# Checking Installation

Let's verify `jfp` is installed:

```bash
jfp --help
```

You should see available commands and options.

---

# Browsing Prompts

List all available prompts in the collection:

```bash
jfp list
```

This shows every prompt with its ID, title, and brief description.

---

# Searching for Prompts

Need something specific? Search by keyword:

```bash
jfp search "code review"
```

This filters prompts matching your query. Try searching for topics relevant to your work.

---

# Viewing Prompt Details

Found something interesting? View the full details:

```bash
jfp show idea-wizard
```

This displays the complete prompt content, metadata, and usage examples.

---

# Copying to Clipboard

Want to paste a prompt into your chat? Copy it:

```bash
jfp copy idea-wizard
```

The prompt is now in your clipboard, ready to paste.

---

# Installing as a Skill

The real power: install prompts directly as Claude Code skills:

```bash
jfp install idea-wizard
```

After installation, you can invoke it in Claude Code:

```bash
/idea-wizard "build a REST API for user management"
```
